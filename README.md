## Logging📝 

This app uses logging extensively to help track its internal operations, errors, and critical events. Logging is essential for debugging and maintaining the app efficiently. 🕵️‍♂️🐞

  ## How it works 🔍
  - All important events like errors, warnings, and info messages are saved to a log file. 📄
  - The log file is located in your system's temporary directory (e.g., C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Temp\customtkinter_editor.log on Windows). 🗂️
  - Each log entry is timestamped, so you can see exactly when an event happened.⏰
  - If the app crashes or encounters any issues during file operations or UI actions, the relevant error details are logged.  ⚠️
  - This helps developers or users to diagnose and fix issues faster.🛠️⚡

```
